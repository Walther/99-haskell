99-haskell
==========


99-haskell is a repository for my solutions of [Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions). These may not be highly optimized and efficient, the prettiest pieces of code golfing you've seen, nor will they (probably) cure world hunger. But hey, it's my effort of trying to learn [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), a very cool language, and why not make my work available for others to look and poke at.

Well hey, uh, say CC-BY. I mean - the idea of these problems is to *learn* the language, so copying these will most probably not make sense. But just putting it out there.
